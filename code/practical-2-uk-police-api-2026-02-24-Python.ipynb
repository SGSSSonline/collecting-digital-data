    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are one of the most important and reliable ways to access data online. Unlike web scraping, which involves parsing the visual structure of web pages and is vulnerable to layout changes, APIs provide a structured, programmatic interface that data providers explicitly design for machine-to-machine communication. This makes them more stable, more efficient, and often more ethical for data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we will work with the [UK Police API](https://data.police.uk/docs/), a freely available, open-data API that provides detailed information on policing in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The data available through this API -- including stop-and-search records, crime reports, and police force information -- are of direct relevance to criminological and sociological research. By the end of this session, you will be comfortable making API requests, processing JSON responses, and converting the results into formats suitable for analysis."

    "\n",
    "1. **Demonstrate how to use Python for API data collection** -- you will learn the key steps involved in requesting data from a web API, handling the response, and saving it in a structured format.\n",
    "2. **Cultivate computational thinking** -- beyond the specific code, this session encourages you to think systematically about how digital data are structured and how to approach data collection tasks programmatically."

    "We covered APIs in detail in Lecture 2, so here we provide only a brief recap. An API (Application Programming Interface) acts as a **translator** between your code and a remote server. You send a request in a format the server understands, and it sends back the data you asked for in a structured format -- typically JSON.\n",

    "Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant: you do not go into the kitchen yourself. Instead, you tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and the waiter brings back your meal (the data). The key advantage is that the data provider controls what is available and how it is delivered, which means the process is predictable, well-documented, and designed for automated access."
