# Collecting Digital Data: The Role of Web-scraping and APIs

## Event Summary

Computational methods are transforming research practice across the disciplines. In this one-day course you will learn how to apply computational methods for the collection and management of data stored on the web. Using Python and R, you will develop skills in collecting data from websites and online databases (APIs); handle a mixture of structured (JSON) and unstructured (raw text) data; and explore how LLMs can support these activities.

Learning outcomes:
1.	Understand how to use open source programming languages (Python and R) for social science research.
2.	Ability to collect data stored on web pages and APIs.
3.	Handle structured and unstructured data formats.
4.	Critique the use of LLMs for conducting social scientific work.
